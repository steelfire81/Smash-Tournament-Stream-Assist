# Smash-Tournament-Stream-Assist
A simple tool I plan to use alongside OBS to quickly update text and icons for a Smash tournament stream.

SETUP:
This is a bit of a workaround I use for streaming that beats going into OBS and manually editing text/images.  For this to work, you will need (preferably within the same folder) FIVE text files (player 1/2 name & score, then one more for match description) and TWO image files (player 1/2 character icons).  I'll upload images of my setup as an example.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
On startup, you can choose to load a config that contains the file locations of previously used files or manually select all the files.  From there it's pretty straightforward.  Icons take a second longer to update than the text.
